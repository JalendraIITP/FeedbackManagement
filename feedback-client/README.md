# Feedback App Frontend

This project is a simple React application designed to collect and display user feedback. The main component, `App`, integrates a feedback form and a list of submitted feedback, arranged in a visually appealing, centered layout.

## Overview of Frontend

The `App` component serves as the main entry point for the React application. It combines two key components: `FeedbackForm` and `FeedbackList`, arranging them in a vertically centered layout with some spacing.

### Key Features

1. **Title**: Displays a heading (`<h1>`) with the text "Feedback App" to clearly indicate the purpose of the application.

2. **FeedbackForm Component**: This component is expected to handle the collection of user feedback, likely containing form elements for users to submit their feedback.

3. **FeedbackList Component**: This component is expected to display a list of feedback items submitted by users.
